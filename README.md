Get into gamedev WGPU raytracer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv0EiQfDI7w)

WGPU web documentation (really mention that this is much better than opengl) https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#gpusampler
WGSL web documentation (much better than opengl) https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/#type-sampler
WGPU rust documentation (https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.Features.html)

Have no idea how to stream object/scene data into WGSL. But we need to do this if we're going to procedurally generate meshes. Also need to figure out how to do ray triangle intersections.
